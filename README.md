## Installation
These steps will help you set up the project on your machine. They were written with UNIX/UNIX-like based systems in mind.

### Prerequisites
You'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to set up this project properly. You'll also need to create environment files, which will be used by the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) if you'll like to run this app on a production server.

### Environment preparation (just for production)
You'll need to create env/ directory with .env.prod and .env.db.prod files in order to run.

#### Example of .env.prod file
```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=key
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=0.0.0.0
DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
DB_DATABASE=crypton
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
DATABASE=postgres
CACHE_BACKEND=django_redis.cache.RedisCache
CACHE_LOCATION=redis://0.0.0.0:6379/1
CACHE_CLIENT_CLASS=django_redis.client.DefaultClient
CACHE_KEY_PREFIX=key
CACHE_HOST=sess
CACHE_PORT=6379
CACHE=redis
```

#### Example of .env.db.prod file
```
POSTGRES_DB=crypton
POSTGRES_USER=crypton
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
```

### Installing
The app can be run with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or [Makefile](Makefile). The second option is more preferred since it provides all basic instructions (build, up, stop etc.) in a shorter form.

#### Development
Building images:
```
make build
```

Running the app:
```
make run
```

#### Production
Building images:
```
make build_prod
```

Running the app:
```
make run_prod
```

## Tests
Run the tests:
```
make test
```

## Lint
Run the lint:
```
make lint
```
